Couchbase Server is a distributed, document database management system, designed to store the information for web applications. Couchbase Server primarily uses RAM as the storage mechanism, enabling it to support very fast create, store, update and retrieval operations.

These features are designed to support web application development where the high-performance characteristics are required to support low-latency and high throughput applications. Couchbase Server achieves this on a single server and provides support for the load to be increased almost linearly by making use of the clustered functionality built into Couchbase Server.
