Riak has a pluggable backend for its core shard-partitioned storage, with the default storage backend being Bitcask as of the 0.12 release. Riak also has built-in MapReduce with native support for both JavaScript (using the SpiderMonkey runtime) and Erlang, while supporting a variety of additional language drivers such as Python, Java, PHP and Ruby.
