\section{Why I created this book?}

Over the past few years the NoSQL popularity has very grown. But writing a book about all NoSQL databases is impossible, because to fully describe a database would require at least a separate book for it. Why I tried to write a book about the several NoSQL databases? The development of any application I have often had questions: <<NoSQL will approach this problem?>>, <<What NoSQL database best solving problems for this application?>> etc. After a long work with different NoSQL databases I decided to create this book. Main goal of this book help to find best NoSQL database which help achieve the goal for your application.
